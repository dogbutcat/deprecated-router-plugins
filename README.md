## CHANGELOG

> 2020-01-09

- UPDATE: v2ray binary version bump to 4.22.1 for compatible usage of my own docker image


## Why this repo created

ehhh... Maybe for some unexpected reason, I can't tell the detail

## What can this repo do

oh! yeah! for v2ray and ss in specific OpenWrt Build(L/E/D/E)

## Where to use this

ennn... download file under packages folder, install through offline plugin install. **BACKUP AT FIRST**

## Who build this

sorry I'm not the developer of this plugin, I only create the `backup` script and add `v2ray install` script, ss is dumped from setting page. maybe it should belong to the DEV-Group who depreacted this one for political reason.

## Disclaimer

what I'm sure about is plugin work fine on my router, and I never add back doors. I can't guarantee the function work well under your situation or the plugin I installed maybe modified. Use it on **YOUR OWN RISK**!
